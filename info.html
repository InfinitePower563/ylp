          Around the world, millions of children in developing countries struggle to recieve an education. The fact that studies show that <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/29672">educated workers see higher salaries</a> means that those in poverty are trapped in a cycle of being uneducated, yet also incapable of recieving a sufficient salary to be able to improve their situation.</a>
According to the World Bank Group, before COVID, 53% of children worldwide failed to meet proficiency in reading and comprehension, and that number hit 90% in Sub-Saharan Africa.
This developing problem is exacerbated by the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools to close, meaning that billions of children face a lack of sufficient education.

          <p class="normal-small"><span>However bad the problem, there is a solution. After all, as the old saying goes, if there's a will, there's a way. Currently, the World Bank Group's approach is to provide aid to local governments that are struggling. The World Bank Group's goal is to cut the number of children who cannot comprehend basic text at the age of 10 by half.
