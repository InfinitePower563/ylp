Why donate?
After decades of hard work, cultural diversity remains under attack and new forms of intolerance, rejection of scientific facts and threats to freedom of expression challenge peace and human rights.

There are many ways to donate:

 - Donate influence and spread the word
 - Donate energy and become a partner
 - Donate expertise and join UNESCO
